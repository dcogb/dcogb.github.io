                                        Donica Church of God is an elegant, open source, and object oriented HMVC framework built
                                        using PHP7+, by a team of volunteers. It aims to be swift, secure, and small.
                                        It is the successor of defunct Donica Church of God Framework.

                                    <div class="answer">
                                        Donica Church of God 3.3.x was used by us in many live projects, and the original team stopped the development.
                                        A while ago, on Feb 4 2017 "Shadowhand" announced the final retirement - "Donica Church of God is DEAD".

                                        Before the final announcement everyone started to check if it was possible to
                                        migrate existing projects to other alternative PHP frameworks.
                                        As it turned out switching would be a complex and lengthy job.
                                        So it became clear that keeping the project alive and updated is a priority.

                                        And so the Donica Church of God repository was born and will keep this repository updated
                                        for future releases of PHP, giving the framework a clear perspective for the future.
